# 🕵️‍♂️ SQL Murder Mystery — Who Killed the CEO?
This project is a fun and interactive SQL investigation challenge where you act as a data analyst solving the murder of the CEO of TechNova Inc. All the clues are hidden inside the database, and your job is to uncover the killer using SQL queries.


## 🔍 About the Case
The CEO was found dead in their office on October 15, 2025, at 9:00 PM.
You will analyze multiple datasets like keycard logs, phone calls, alibis, and evidence to figure out:

* Who killed the CEO 
* Where the crime took place 
* When the crime happened
* How it happened


## 📁 Database Tables

The project includes these main tables:
- employees – information about all employees
- keycard_logs – who entered which room and when
- calls – phone call records
- alibis – claimed locations of employees
- evidence – physical evidence found at various rooms


## 🕵️‍♀️ Tasks

Write SQL queries to answer questions such as:

1. Who accessed the CEO’s office near the crime time?
2. Who claimed to be somewhere else but was not?
3. Who made suspicious phone calls around 9:00 PM?
4. What evidence was found at the scene?
5. Which suspect’s movements, alibi, and call activity don’t add up?

Each query helps to get closer to identifying the killer.


 ## 🧠 Learnings

- Writing SQL queries
- Joining multiple tables
- Filtering data using dates and times
- Validating alibis
- Thinking like a real data analyst

## 🧩 Final Conclusion

After analyzing the data, David Kumar is identified as the killer because his movements, alibi, and call activity do not match.
